Electrical energy is distributed as alternating current because AC voltage may be increased or decreased with a transformer. This allows the power to be transmitted through power lines efficiently at high voltage, which reduces the energy lost as heat due to resistance of the wire, and transformed to a lower, safer, voltage for use. Use of a higher voltage leads to significantly more efficient transmission of power. The power losses ({\displaystyle P_{\rm {w}}}{\displaystyle P_{\rm {w}}}) in the wire are a product of the square of the current ( I ) and the resistance (R) of the wire, described by the formula:
